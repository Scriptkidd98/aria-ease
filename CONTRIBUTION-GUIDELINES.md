# How You Can Contribute

## For new contributors

Create a new branch using format feature e.g add-support-for-input, clean-up-tab-event-listeners e.t.c. That'll be the branch where you can push commits to, and create pull requests from.

## For returning contributors

Open a new issue, as detailed as possible. Fix and test issue locally. Create a pull request to dev branch, and await review and/or merge.

## Contribution Guidelines

Write all functions in type-safe TypeScript.

Test features vigorously, for keyboard and screen reader users.

Algorithms must follow best software practices.

All functions must be JSDoc documented.

All commits must have either format; "fix: fixed event listener perfomance leak" for issues fixing or refactoring, or "build: added ... feature" for creating an entirely new feature that didn't exist before.
